# Hackathon

Idea
==
With the ability of music to convey emotion, a person's music history can directly correlate to their mood. Wouldn't you want to know what kind mood you've had throughout the day?

Implementation
==
Using Spotify's open API, we are going to find out a users previous ten songs. We will analyse the lyrics in said songs to determine the overall emotion of every individual song. Then plot the data in a nice easy to read format. This will all be done through a convenitent and easy to decipher website.
