# Hackathon

Idea
===
For this project we are trying to help students stay more on track with due dates. We have noticed that most students have a hard time with due dates and organization in computer science.
With all the projects we need to keep track of on top of basic school work it can become really overwhelming. Since Brightspace only allows you to access its calander, notifications, and
new posted assignments when it is running in your browser this can make our lives harder. Since most students are on their phones and using google calanders anyways we thoughtit would
be most benifical 
With brightspace there are a few issues with notifications with new assignments posted. This calander is supposed to help 
By taking in Brightspace due dates and exporting them to our own personal google calanders. 
With this project we will be able to stay more ontop of due dates for each class. It also allows us to set up calander notifications and get them straight to our phones.
