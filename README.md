# Hackathon

Idea
===
For this project we are trying to help students stay more on track with due dates. We have noticed that most students have a hard time with due dates and organization in computer science.
With all the projects we need to keep track of on top of basic school work it can become really overwhelming. Since Brightspace only allows you to access its calander, notifications, and
new posted assignments when it is running in your browser this can make our lives harder. Since most students are on their phones and using google calanders anyways we thoughtit would
be most benifical 
With brightspace there are a few issues with notifications with new assignments posted. This calander is supposed to help 
By taking in Brightspace due dates and exporting them to our own personal google calanders. 
With this project we will be able to stay more ontop of due dates for each class. It also allows us to set up calander notifications and get them straight to our phones.

Problem
===
Staying on top of your school work can be overwhelming and confusing especially when due dates can be tricky to find. Using Brightspace we have noticed that you can not access due dates
if you are not on the website. If you want to put in due dates you need to manually update due dates in your own calander. This process can lead to errors in data transfer and if you are not careful you can miss assignments all together.

Calander
===
This calander is simple to access from your phone on google calander. This system will take the due dates and assignments from Brightspace right onto your person calander. This calander will be able to send notifications when it adds a new assignemnt and when an assingment is coming up.
